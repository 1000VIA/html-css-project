First step is to fork this repo into your own Github account - if you don't remember how, then refer back Lesson0 contents.

## For Week 1

Create a new webpage on a subject that you're interested in (maybe the same topic you used for your Codepen submission). The page should **NOT** use any framework like Bootstrap and it should include the following elements:
  - The `.html` page and a linked `.css` file applies a consistent color scheme to links and text on your page.
  - A page header with a title and description for the site.
  - An articles section with three articles, each including a title, summary and a link.
  - Proper use of the semantic HTML tags we discussed.
  - Research the `:first-child` pseudo-class and use it to style the first article so that it stands out from the others.
  - Use this website [Lorem Ipsum](http://www.lipsum.com/) to generate random blocks of contents to fill your website.
  - **Add your website to Github and expose it on github.io like we did in week 0 for the  **
  - Make your website look as close as possible as this layout (there are things we didn't cover yet, such as layout of the right and left side, but consider that an optional challenge if you want one)

  </a>
  - **Commit often (with good meaningful commit messages), and Push to Github regularly.**
  
  
  ## For Week 2
  We will improve on the first site to:
  - Layout the different parts of the site properly (left side main content and the right side content)
  - We will make the website responsive
  
  ## For Week 3
  - Explore mobile-first
  - Explore how we name our classes and elements
  - Use a framework to implement the same site and compare
